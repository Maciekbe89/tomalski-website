## Tomalski - WebSite by [@Maciekbe89](http://github.com/Maciekbe89)!

## Hello!

I made a new website for my friend. I created it in REACTJS and I used SCSS for styling.

![src/assets/screens/tml2.gif](src/assets/screens/tml2.gif)

Simple design, five sections on the one view:

- about me, with description
- discography, with covers and possibility of download whole CDs.
- videos, with clips from youtube.
- player, I used special library called "react-responsive-music-player", now you can listen all tracks without download.
- contact,

On the left-top is logo, when we click it, view will return to the first section. For the scroll effect in navbar I used library "Smooth-Scrolling".

It works well in multiple resolutions (mobile, tablet, desktop).
